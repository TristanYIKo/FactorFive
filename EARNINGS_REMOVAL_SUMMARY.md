# ✅ Earnings Section Removal - Complete

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Reason:** Unreliable earnings dates from Finnhub free tier API

---

## 🗑️ What Was Removed

### **Frontend Changes**

**File:** `app/ticker/[symbol]/page.tsx`

**Removed:**
- ❌ Entire "Upcoming Earnings" card (60+ lines)
- ❌ Earnings date display
- ❌ EPS estimate display
- ❌ Revenue estimate display
- ❌ "Verify on company IR page" disclaimer

**Before:**
```tsx
{/* Earnings Card */}
{data.earnings && (
  <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 mb-6">
    <h2>📅 Upcoming Earnings</h2>
    {/* Date, EPS, Revenue displays */}
  </div>
)}
```

**After:**
```tsx
{/* Removed - earnings data unreliable */}
```

---

### **Backend Changes**

**File:** `app/api/stock/route.ts`

**Removed:**
1. ❌ Earnings API call to Finnhub `/calendar/earnings` endpoint
2. ❌ `earningsRes` from Promise.all array
3. ❌ `earningsData` parsing
4. ❌ Earnings sorting logic (15 lines)
5. ❌ Earnings date filtering logic
6. ❌ `nextEarnings` variable
7. ❌ `FinnhubEarnings` import
8. ❌ `EarningsEvent` import

**Changed:**
```typescript
// Before: 8 API calls
const [quoteRes, profileRes, newsRes, earningsRes, financialsRes, ...] = await Promise.all([...]);

// After: 7 API calls (earnings removed)
const [quoteRes, profileRes, newsRes, financialsRes, ...] = await Promise.all([...]);

// Before: Complex earnings sorting
let nextEarnings = sortedEarnings.filter(...)[0];

// After: Simple null assignment
earnings: null, // Earnings data removed due to unreliable free API data
```

### **Files Modified**

1. **`app/ticker/[symbol]/page.tsx`**
   - Lines removed: ~60 lines
   - Change: Removed entire earnings card section

2. **`app/api/stock/route.ts`**
   - Lines removed: ~20 lines
   - Changes:
     - Removed earnings API call
     - Removed earnings parsing
     - Removed sorting logic
     - Set `earnings: null` in response

### **Type Safety Maintained**
