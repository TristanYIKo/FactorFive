# Intelligent Stock Scoring Engine - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Stock Score system has been completely redesigned to use **context-aware, relative analysis** instead of absolute thresholds. Scores are now calculated using statistical methods (z-scores and percentile rankings) that compare each stock to its industry peers, ensuring fair comparisons across different sectors and market conditions.

---

## Key Principles

### 1. **Relative vs Absolute Scoring**
- **Old System**: Used fixed thresholds (e.g., "P/E < 15 = good")
- **New System**: Compares metrics to industry averages and peer distributions

**Why this matters**: A P/E of 40 might be overvalued for a bank but perfectly reasonable for a high-growth SaaS company. Context matters.

### 2. **Z-Score Normalization**
Every metric is converted to a z-score that shows how many standard deviations it is from the industry mean:
- **Z-score = 0**: Average (50th percentile)
- **Z-score = +1**: One std dev above average (~84th percentile)
- **Z-score = +2**: Two std devs above average (~98th percentile)
- **Z-score = -1**: One std dev below average (~16th percentile)

This approach automatically adjusts for industry norms and volatility.

### 3. **Percentile Rankings**
Each component score includes a percentile ranking (0-100) showing where the stock stands relative to peers:
- **80th percentile** = Better than 80% of peers
- **50th percentile** = Median performance
- **20th percentile** = Below 80% of peers

## Scoring Components (20 points each = 100 total)

### ðŸ“ˆ Growth Score (0-20 points)

**What it measures**:
- Revenue growth rate (quarterly YoY or annual)
- EPS (Earnings Per Share) growth rate
- Compared to industry median and distribution

**How it's calculated**:
1. Fetch peer company growth rates from Finnhub
2. Calculate industry average and standard deviation
3. Compute z-scores for the company's growth rates
4. Convert z-scores to points (10 pts revenue + 10 pts EPS)

**Scoring logic**:
```
Z-score of +2 = 20 points (top performer)
Z-score of  0 = 10 points (average)
Z-score of -2 = 0 points (bottom performer)
```

**Example tooltip**:
> "78th percentile vs 10 peers. Strong growth relative to Software sector"

**Why relative scoring matters**:
- A 5% growth rate is excellent for a utility company but poor for a tech startup
- Industry context prevents unfair comparisons

---

### ðŸ’° Profitability Score (0-20 points)

**What it measures**:
- Return on Equity (ROE)
- Net Profit Margin
- Operating Margin
- All relative to industry benchmarks

**Weighting**:
- ROE: 8 points (most important - shows capital efficiency)
- Net Margin: 6 points
- Operating Margin: 6 points

**Example**:
A retail company with 5% net margin might score high if peers average 2%, while a software company with 15% margin might score low if peers average 25%.

---

### ðŸ’Ž Valuation Score (0-20 points)

**Revolutionary approach**: Does NOT blindly penalize high P/E ratios!

**What it measures**:
- P/E ratio relative to industry average
- P/B (Price-to-Book) ratio relative to industry
- **INVERTED scoring**: Lower valuation = higher score

**Key insight**:
```
Tech company: P/E of 35 vs industry avg 40 = Good value (high score)
Industrial:  P/E of 35 vs industry avg 12 = Overvalued (low score)
```

**Scoring logic**:
1. Calculate z-score for P/E vs peers
2. **Invert it** (negative z-score becomes positive)
3. Convert to points

**Example**: 
- Company P/E: 25
- Industry avg: 30
- Z-score: -0.5 (below average)
- **Inverted**: +0.5 (good value!)
- Score: ~12/20

---

### ðŸš€ Momentum Score (0-20 points)

**What it measures**:
- Daily price change relative to sector
- 52-week price position (how close to high vs low)
- Price vs analyst target (upside potential)

**Weighting**:
- Daily momentum (z-scored vs peers): 10 points
- 52-week position: 10 points

**Example**:
```
Daily change: +2.5% (sector avg: +0.5%)
Z-score: +1.5 â†’ 8 points

52-week position: 85% â†’ 8.5 points

Total: 16.5/20 = Strong momentum
```

---

### ðŸ‘” Analyst Score (0-20 points)

**What it measures**:
- Buy/Hold/Sell recommendation distribution
- Price target upside vs current price
- Analyst confidence and consensus

**Weighting**:
- Recommendation consensus: 15 points
- Price target upside: 5 points

**Example**:
```
Recommendations: 15 buy, 5 hold, 0 sell (75% bullish)
Points: (75/100) * 15 = 11.25

Target upside: 18% above current
Points: 4

Total: 15.25/20 = Strong analyst support
```

### Finn hub Endpoints Used

**For target company**:
- `/quote` - Price data
- `/stock/profile2` - Company info & industry classification
- `/stock/metric` - Financial metrics (growth, profitability, valuation)
- `/stock/recommendation` - Analyst ratings
- `/stock/price-target` - Analyst targets
- `/company-news` - Recent news
- `/calendar/earnings` - Upcoming earnings

**For peer analysis**:
- `/stock/peers` - Get list of similar companies
- `/quote` (per peer) - Price data for momentum
- `/stock/metric` (per peer) - Financial metrics

### Performance Optimization

**Parallel fetching**: All peer data fetched simultaneously using `Promise.all()`

**Peer limiting**: Max 10 peers to balance accuracy with API call limits

**Error handling**: Graceful degradation if peer data unavailable (defaults to neutral scores)

## Score Interpretation

| Total Score | Rating | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 80-100 | ðŸŸ¢ Strong Buy | Exceptional fundamentals across all metrics |
| 70-79 | ðŸŸ¢ Buy | Strong performance in most areas |
| 55-69 | ðŸŸ¡ Moderate Buy | Above average with some strong points |
| 40-54 | ðŸŸ¡ Hold | Mixed signals, average overall |
| 25-39 | ðŸ”´ Sell | Below average performance |
| 0-24 | ðŸ”´ Strong Sell | Weak fundamentals, significant concerns |

**Important**: Scores reflect **relative performance** within an industry, not absolute quality. A 60 score in high-quality tech sector may represent a better investment than an 75 score in a struggling industry.

| **Fairness** | Same thresholds for all industries | Industry-specific benchmarks |
| **Market Cycles** | Fixed rules get outdated | Self-adjusting to conditions |
| **Differentiation** | Most stocks cluster around 50 | Full 0-100 range utilized |
| **Actionability** | Surface-level | Deep contextual insights |
