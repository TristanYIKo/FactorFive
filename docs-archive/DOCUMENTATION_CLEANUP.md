## Next Steps

When pushing to GitHub:
1. Git will detect 21 file moves (shown as deletions + additions)
2. The `docs-archive/` folder will be included in the repository
3. Links in archived docs may need updating if referenced elsewhere
4. Consider adding `.gitattributes` if you want GitHub to detect renames

## Commands Used

```bash
# Created archive directory
mkdir docs-archive

# Moved files in batches
Move-Item -Path <files> -Destination "docs-archive\"

# Created archive README for context
