# üìÖ Earnings Data Accuracy - Important Information

## Current Status

Your application displays **upcoming earnings dates** for stocks, but the data source (Finnhub Free Tier) has **limitations** that may result in inaccurate or missing earnings dates.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### **1. Finnhub Free Tier Restrictions**
- **Limited Historical Data**: Free tier may not have the most recent earnings calendar updates
- **Coverage Gaps**: Not all companies have earnings data available
- **Update Frequency**: Earnings dates may not be updated immediately when companies announce changes
- **Premium Data**: Accurate, real-time earnings calendars typically require premium data subscriptions

### **2. Why Earnings Dates Can Be Wrong**
- Companies often announce earnings dates with only 2-4 weeks notice
- Earnings dates can change due to various corporate reasons
- Free data providers may lag behind official company announcements
- Some companies don't publish earnings calendars far in advance

---

## ‚úÖ Recent Improvements Made

### **Backend Changes (app/api/stock/route.ts)**

1. **Extended Date Range**: Changed from 90 to 120 days to catch quarterly earnings
2. **Date Sorting**: Added logic to sort earnings by date and filter out past dates
3. **Better Filtering**: Only show future earnings dates, skip historical ones

```typescript
// Sort earnings by date (ascending) to get the earliest upcoming one
const sortedEarnings = [...earningsData.earningsCalendar].sort((a, b) => {
  return new Date(a.date).getTime() - new Date(b.date).getTime();
});

// Filter to only future dates (in case API returns past earnings)
const futureEarnings = sortedEarnings.filter(e => new Date(e.date) >= new Date());
```

### **Frontend Changes (app/ticker/[symbol]/page.tsx)**

Added disclaimer: **"Verify on company IR page"** to the earnings card header

---

## üéØ How to Verify Earnings Dates

### **Official Sources (Always Most Accurate)**

For each company, check their official Investor Relations page:

| Company | Earnings Calendar URL |
|---------|---------------------|
| Apple (AAPL) | https://investor.apple.com/investor-relations/default.aspx |
| Microsoft (MSFT) | https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor |
| Amazon (AMZN) | https://ir.aboutamazon.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx |
| Google (GOOGL) | https://abc.xyz/investor/ |
| Tesla (TSLA) | https://ir.tesla.com/ |
| NVIDIA (NVDA) | https://investor.nvidia.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx |

**General Pattern**: Most companies use `investor.{company}.com` or `ir.{company}.com`

### **Reputable Third-Party Sources**

1. **Yahoo Finance**: https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar/earnings
2. **MarketWatch**: https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/earnings
3. **Nasdaq**: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings
4. **Seeking Alpha**: https://seekingalpha.com/earnings/earnings-calendar
5. **Earnings Whispers**: https://www.earningswhispers.com/calendar

## üîß How to Improve Earnings Data Accuracy

### **Option 1: Upgrade to Premium Data Provider** (Recommended)

**Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)** - Professional financial data
- **Cost**: ~$14-29/month
- **Accuracy**: Very high (institutional-grade data)
- **Coverage**: All major US stocks + international
- **API Endpoint**: `/v3/earning_calendar`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Add FMP API call
const fmpEarningsUrl = `https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/earning_calendar?symbol=${symbol}&apikey=${FMP_API_KEY}`;
```

**Alpha Vantage** - Another good option
- **Cost**: $49/month for premium
- **Endpoint**: `EARNINGS_CALENDAR`

---

### **Option 2: Add Manual Override System**

Create a local database to override incorrect earnings dates:

**File**: `lib/earningsOverrides.ts`
```typescript
export const earningsOverrides: Record<string, { date: string; time: string }> = {
  'AAPL': { date: '2025-01-30', time: 'amc' },
  'MSFT': { date: '2025-01-28', time: 'amc' },
  'AMZN': { date: '2025-02-01', time: 'amc' },
  // Add more as needed
};
```

Then in `app/api/stock/route.ts`:
```typescript
import { earningsOverrides } from '@/lib/earningsOverrides';

// After fetching earnings from API
if (earningsOverrides[symbol]) {
  nextEarnings = {
    date: earningsOverrides[symbol].date,
    hour: earningsOverrides[symbol].time,
    // ... other fields
  };
}
```

---

### **Option 3: Scrape Company IR Pages** (Advanced)

Use a web scraper to pull earnings dates directly from company IR pages:

**Pros:**
- Most accurate (source of truth)
- Free (no API costs)

**Cons:**
- Each company has different HTML structure
- Requires maintenance when sites change
- Slower (HTTP requests + parsing)
- May violate ToS for some sites

**Libraries:**
- **Cheerio** (Node.js HTML parsing)
- **Puppeteer** (Headless browser)

---

### **Option 4: User-Submitted Corrections**

Add a feature for users to report incorrect earnings dates:

1. "Report incorrect date" button on earnings card
2. Store corrections in database
3. Display community-sourced dates with confidence indicator
4. Verify against multiple sources

---

## üìä Current Implementation Details

### **API Call**
```typescript
// app/api/stock/route.ts line 140
const earningsUrl = `https://finnhub.io/api/v1/calendar/earnings?symbol=${symbol}&from=${today}&to=${120DaysLater}&token=${FINNHUB_KEY}`;
```
