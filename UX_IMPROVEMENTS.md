# UX Improvements & News Relevance Filtering

## Changes Made

### 1. üîç **Quick Search Bar on Ticker Page**
**Location:** Top of `/ticker/[symbol]` page

**Features:**
- Added search bar in the top navigation
- Search another ticker without going back home
- Responsive design (full width on mobile, compact on desktop)
- Preserves all functionality while adding convenience

**Usage:**
1. Type a new ticker symbol (e.g., "TSLA")
2. Click "Go" or press Enter
3. Instantly navigate to the new stock analysis

### 2. üè† **Updated Navigation Text**
Changed "Back to Search" ‚Üí "Back to Home" for clarity

**Why:** The home page is more than just a search - it's the landing page with branding and context.

### 3. üì∞ **Intelligent News Relevance Filtering**
**New File:** `lib/newsFilter.ts`

**Problem Solved:**
- NewsAPI returns articles that mention the company name but aren't actually relevant
- Generic market news was cluttering company-specific analysis
- Spam/promotional articles were appearing in results

**Solution - Smart Relevance Scoring:**

#### **High Relevance (+10 points):**
- Ticker symbol in title (e.g., "AAPL" in title)
- Company name in title (e.g., "Apple Inc.")
- Company first word in title (e.g., "Apple")

#### **Medium Relevance (+5 points):**
- Ticker/company name in description
- Reputable sources (Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, WSJ, etc.)

#### **Penalties:**
- Generic market terms without company name (-5 points)
  - "stock market", "wall street", "dow jones", etc.
- Spam indicators (-20 points, effectively filters out)
  - "sponsored", "trade now", "subscribe", etc.

#### **Result:**
- Shows 8 most relevant articles (increased from 5)
- Company-specific news appears first
- Spam and irrelevant articles filtered out
- Minimum relevance score of 3 to appear

### 4. üé® **Text Selection Disabled**
**Location:** `globals.css`

**Changes:**
- Disabled text cursor/caret on non-interactive elements
- Prevents accidental text selection
- Re-enabled for inputs, textareas, and code blocks
- Maintains pointer cursor for clickable elements

## Technical Implementation

### News Filtering Algorithm

```typescript
filterAndSortNewsByRelevance(
  articles: NewsAPIArticle[],
  companyName: string,
  symbol: string,
  minScore: number = 3
)
```

**Relevance Score Calculation:**
1. **Title Analysis** (highest weight)
   - Exact ticker match: +10
   - Full company name: +8
   - Company first word: +6

2. **Description Analysis** (medium weight)
   - Exact ticker match: +5
   - Full company name: +4
   - Company first word: +3

3. **Source Quality Bonus**
   - Reputable sources: +2

4. **Generic News Penalty**
   - Generic terms in title (without company): -5
   - Generic terms in description: -2

5. **Spam Detection**
   - Promotional content: -20

### Example Relevance Scores

For **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**:

| Article Title | Score | Why |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| "AAPL Beats Q3 Earnings Expectations" | 18 | Ticker in title (+10), reputable source (+2), positive keywords (+6) |
| "Apple Unveils New iPhone 16" | 14 | Company name in title (+8), tech source (+2), innovation (+4) |
| "Tech Stocks Rally as Market Surges" | 0 | Generic market news, no company mention |
| "Buy AAPL Now! Limited Time!" | -20 | Spam indicator, filtered out |

### Search Bar Component

```tsx
<form onSubmit={handleSearchSubmit}>
  <input
    type="text"
    value={searchTicker}
    onChange={(e) => setSearchTicker(e.target.value)}
    placeholder="Search another ticker..."
    maxLength={10}
  />
  <button type="submit">Go</button>
</form>
```

## User Experience Improvements

‚ùå Text cursor appeared when clicking on metrics  

### After:
‚úÖ Quick search bar at top of every ticker page  
‚úÖ "Back to Home" clearly indicates where you're going  
‚úÖ Smart relevance filtering - company-specific news first  
‚úÖ Spam and promotional content filtered out  
‚úÖ 8 relevant articles instead of 5 random ones  
‚úÖ Clean UI - no accidental text selection

## News Filtering Examples

### Example 1: Apple (AAPL)
**Relevant Articles Shown:**
- "Apple Reports Record Q4 Revenue"
- "AAPL Reaches All-Time High After Product Launch"
- "Apple's AI Strategy Impresses Analysts"

**Filtered Out:**
- "10 Stocks to Buy Now" (generic, mentions AAPL in list)
- "Market Update: Tech Stocks Mixed" (no company focus)
- "Trade AAPL with Zero Commission!" (spam)

### Example 2: Tesla (TSLA)
**Relevant Articles Shown:**
- "Tesla Delivers Record Vehicles in Q3"
- "TSLA Stock Surges on Cybertruck Production News"

**Filtered Out:**
- "EV Market Analysis: Rivian vs Lucid" (competitor focus)
- "S&P 500 Reaches New High" (generic market)

## Configuration

### Adjusting Relevance Threshold

In `app/ticker/[symbol]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
filterAndSortNewsByRelevance(
  data.newsAPIArticles,
  data.profile.name,
  data.symbol,
  3  // ‚Üê Change this number
)
```

**Thresholds:**
- `0` - Show all non-spam articles (most permissive)
- `3` - **Default** - Good balance of relevance
- `5` - Only articles with company name/ticker (strict)
- `8` - Only articles with company name in title (very strict)

### Number of Articles Shown

```typescript
.slice(0, 8)  // ‚Üê Change to show more/fewer articles
```

Currently showing **8 articles** (increased from 5 for better coverage)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Filtering:**
   - ML-based relevance scoring

   - Topic clustering (earnings, product launches, lawsuits, etc.)

2. **Search Bar Improvements:**
   - Autocomplete with ticker suggestions
   - Recent searches history
   - Save favorite tickers

3. **News Features:**
   - Category tabs (Company News, Market News, Opinion)
   - Time-based filtering (24h, 7d, 30d)
   - Source filtering (choose preferred news outlets)

4. **Performance:**
   - Cache news relevance scores
   - Preload next likely ticker search
   - Lazy load news images
